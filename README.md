# Sudoku (in progress)

Hi and welcome to the remastered sudoku game which is under progress! 

This game is in some sense a funnier sudoku. The rules stay the same : fill the grid without repeating a value whether in rows, columns or squares, with the major exception that we do not have square but 'shape' composed of cells dispersed throughout the grid.

For the moment the following is possible : 
- Generate a sudoku grid with a desired size (between 4x4 and 9x9).
- Check if there already exists a same value whether in rows, columns or shapes.

The hardest part is yet to come : 
- Generate a totally solvable sudoku grid.
- Then, randomly remove some values in the above solvable grid.
- And may be more things that have not come to mind yet.

Want to see how does it look for the moment ? [Take a look right here!](https://zahjen.github.io/Sudoku-in-progress/)
